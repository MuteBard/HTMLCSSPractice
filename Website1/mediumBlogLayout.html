          A minimalistic, but powerful uptime & performance monitoring service
          for websites and APIs. In this post I’ll cover features of Apex Ping,
          why I chose to build it first, and a few things I learned in the
          process. In future posts I’ll be detailing the implementation for
          anyone who is curious. I soft-launched Ping about a month ago,
          built almost 100% on AWS Lambda, with 500 users it has already
          detected over a million errors, and performed over 25 million checks.
          Big thanks to the early adopters who have checked it out!
